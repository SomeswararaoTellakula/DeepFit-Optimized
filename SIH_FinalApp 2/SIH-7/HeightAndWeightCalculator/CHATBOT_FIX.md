# Chatbot Fix - Model Error Resolution

## Issue
Chatbot was showing "Model error. Please contact support. (Model: gemini-pro)" error.

## Root Cause
1. Old API key may have been invalid or expired
2. Model auto-detection was failing
3. gemini-pro model may not be available with the API key

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated API Key
**File:** `chatbot_routes.py`
```python
GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

### 2. Fixed Model Selection
**File:** `gemini_chatbot.py`

**Changed from:** Auto-detection with fallback to gemini-pro
**Changed to:** Direct use of gemini-1.5-flash (most reliable)

```python
# Use gemini-1.5-flash model (most reliable and available)
self.text_model_name = 'gemini-1.5-flash'
self.vision_model_name = 'gemini-1.5-flash'
```

### 3. Improved Error Handling
Added specific error messages for:
- Quota exceeded
- Permission denied
- Invalid API key
- Model not found
- General errors

```python
if "quota" in error_msg.lower() or "resource_exhausted" in error_msg.lower():
    return "⚠️ API quota exceeded. Please try again later or check your API key limits."
elif "permission" in error_msg.lower() or "403" in error_msg:
    return "⚠️ Permission denied. Please verify your API key has proper permissions."
elif "invalid" in error_msg.lower() or "api_key" in error_msg.lower():
    return "⚠️ Invalid API key. Please check your Gemini API key."
```

### 4. Removed Auto-Detection
Removed complex model detection functions that were causing issues:
- `_get_best_text_model()`
- `_get_best_vision_model()`

## Testing

### Test 1: Simple Text Message
```
User: "Hello"
Expected: Chatbot responds with greeting
```

### Test 2: Question
```
User: "What is fitness?"
Expected: Chatbot provides detailed answer about fitness
```

### Test 3: Image Upload
```
User: Uploads image
Expected: Chatbot analyzes and describes image
```

## Verification Steps

1. Open chatbot widget
2. Type "Hello" and send
3. Should receive response without "Model error"
4. Try asking questions about fitness/sports
5. Verify responses are generated correctly

## API Key Information

**Current API Key:** YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY

**Model Used:** gemini-1.5-flash
- Most reliable Gemini model
- Supports both text and vision
- Fast response times
- Good availability

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `chatbot_routes.py` - Updated API key
2. ✅ `gemini_chatbot.py` - Fixed model selection and error handling

## Expected Behavior Now

✅ Chatbot responds to text messages
✅ Chatbot analyzes images
✅ Chatbot processes files
✅ Clear error messages if issues occur
✅ No "Model error" messages

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Getting Errors:

**Error: "API quota exceeded"**
- Solution: Wait for quota reset or upgrade API plan

**Error: "Permission denied"**
- Solution: Verify API key has Gemini API enabled in Google Cloud Console

**Error: "Invalid API key"**
- Solution: Check API key is correct and active

**Error: "Model not found"**
- Solution: Verify API key has access to gemini-1.5-flash model

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Chatbot should now work correctly with new API key and gemini-1.5-flash model
