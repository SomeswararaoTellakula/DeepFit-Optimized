# Temporary Fallback Solution

## The Issue
The provided API key is not working. This could be because:
1. The key is invalid or expired
2. The key doesn't have Gemini API access
3. Quota has been exceeded
4. API is not enabled in Google Cloud Console

## Immediate Solution: Get a Valid API Key

### Quick Steps:

1. **Visit Google AI Studio**
   - Go to: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   - OR: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

2. **Sign in with Google Account**
   - Use any Google account
   - Accept terms if prompted

3. **Create API Key**
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Select "Create API key in new project"
   - **COPY THE KEY IMMEDIATELY**

4. **Update chatbot_routes.py**
   ```python
   GEMINI_API_KEY = "paste_your_new_key_here"
   ```

5. **Restart Flask Server**
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Test Chatbot**
   - Open browser
   - Click chatbot icon
   - Type "Hello"
   - Should work!

## Why Current Key Doesn't Work

The key `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` is showing errors because:

- ❌ May be invalid or test key
- ❌ May not have Gemini API enabled
- ❌ May have exceeded free quota
- ❌ May be restricted or revoked

## What You Need to Do NOW

### Option 1: Get New Free API Key (Recommended)
1. Go to https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Create new API key (takes 30 seconds)
3. Replace in chatbot_routes.py
4. Restart server
5. Done!

### Option 2: Check Current Key Status
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Find your API key
3. Check if Gemini API is enabled
4. Check quota usage

### Option 3: Use Different Google Account
If your account has quota issues:
1. Sign out
2. Sign in with different Google account
3. Create new API key
4. Use that key

## Testing the Fix

After getting new API key:

```bash
# Test the key
python test_api_quick.py

# Should show:
# ✓ API key configured
# ✓ gemini-pro WORKS!
# Response: Hello! How can I help you today?
```

## Files to Update

1. **chatbot_routes.py** (Line 9)
   ```python
   GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_new_api_key_here"
   ```

2. **test_api_quick.py** (Line 6)
   ```python
   API_KEY = "your_new_api_key_here"
   ```

## After Updating

1. Save files
2. Stop Flask server (Ctrl+C)
3. Start Flask server: `python app.py`
4. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
5. Test chatbot

## Expected Result

✅ Chatbot opens
✅ You type "Hello"
✅ Chatbot responds: "Hello! How can I help you today?"
✅ No errors

## Still Not Working?

If still getting errors after new API key:

1. **Check Console Output**
   - Look at Flask server terminal
   - Should show: "✓ Chatbot initialized successfully"

2. **Check Browser Console**
   - Press F12
   - Look for errors in Console tab

3. **Verify API Key**
   - Go to https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   - Confirm key is active
   - Try generating a new one

4. **Check Internet Connection**
