# DeepFit: AI-Powered Fitness & Diagnostic System

DeepFit is a comprehensive, AI-driven fitness platform designed to provide accurate health diagnostics and exercise tracking using computer vision. Built for inclusivity and security, DeepFit leverages advanced pose estimation and face verification to deliver a premium personal training experience.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. AI Diagnostics
- **Height & Weight Estimation**: Non-contact measurement using computer vision and anthropometric analysis.
- **Vertical Jump Analyzer**: High-precision jump height calculation with real-time feedback.

### 2. Exercise Tracking
- **Sit-up Counter**: Automated rep counting with form quality analysis.
- **Dumbbell Curl Tracker**: Dual-arm tracking with angle detection and weight estimation.

### 3. Security & Personalization
- **Identity-Based Access**: Integrated **Face Verification** system. The app compares live user frames against registration photos to gate access to diagnostics.
- **User Dashboard**: Detailed performance history and trend analysis stored in MongoDB.

### 4. Mobile Integration
- **Siri Integration (iOS)**: Launch exercises hands-free using custom AppIntents and Shortcuts.
- **Google Assistant (Android)**: Voice-activated app features via Android Shortcuts.

### 5. Inclusive Design
- Optimized interfaces and workflows for users with varying physical abilities, ensuring fitness is accessible to everyone.
